- Micro-SD card for removable datalogging and storage   
- Real-time clock with battery backup   
- USB interface for battery recharging as well as PC-based communications, programming, debugging or data analysis   
- Barometric pressure sensor (30,000 feet approx. maximum)   
- 3-axis MEMS gyroscope   
- 3-axis accelerometer   
- 3-axis magnetometer   
- Single-axis high-range accelerometer (up to 200 g-units) for rocket motor characterisation   
- Differential pressre transducer for pitot tube airspeed measurement   
- Temperature sensor   
- Central microcontroller (Atmel ATmega2561)   
- On-board Silicon Labs Si1000 microcontroller with integrated UHF transceiver (100mW transmit power)   
- Power supply from a single 3.7V lithium-polymer cell, with on-board recharge control   
- 8 channels of 0-4096mV analog data acquisition from additional external payload electronics.   
- Support for a range of different GPS receiver modules and different antenna types, mounted away from the main board to provide more flexible antenna mounting.   
- Support for a range of different external RF telemetry hardware if more performance is desired than the on-board Si1000 can provide.   
- For example, the RFDesign RFD900 900 MHz RF modem can be used, which consists of a Si1000 microcontroller with external RF LNA and PA, providing telemetry ranges of up to
nearly 100 kilometers with line-of-sight.
